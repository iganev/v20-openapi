      description: >-
        Get a stream of Account Prices starting from when the request is
        made.

        This pricing stream does not include every single price created
        for the Account, but instead will provide at most 4 prices per second
        (every 250 milliseconds) for each instrument being requested.

        If more than one price is created for an instrument during the 250
        millisecond window, only the price in effect at the end of the window
        is sent. This means that during periods of rapid price movement,
        subscribers to this stream will not be sent every price.

        Pricing windows for different connections to the price stream are
        not all aligned in the same way (i.e. they are not all aligned to
        the top of the second). This means that during periods of rapid
        price movement, different subscribers may observe different prices
        depending on their alignment.

          The Unix representation is a string representing the number of
          seconds since the Unix Epoch (January 1st, 1970 at UTC). The value
          is a fractional number, where the fractional part represents a
          fraction of a second (up to nine decimal places).
